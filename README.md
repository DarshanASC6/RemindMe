# RemindMe

# What is it?
A python script that will remind me to do certain things every so often. Basically a bastardized version of my Drink Python script, but it can take multiple inputs and times.

# How does it work?
Good question. I'm not completely sure myself. This entire thing would not exist without Google, various StackExchange forums, and the countless amazing people who blog about the features of Python, what they do, and how to use them.

# How do I use it?
1. Enter a list of things to be reminded about, seperated by a comma and a space
    Ex: Remind me to: eat, sleep

2. Enter how long until you're reminded to do them
    Ex: How many minutes until I remind you? 5
    (5 minutes until the reminder)

3. Wait to be reminded
