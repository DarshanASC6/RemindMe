# RemindMe

# What is it?
A python script that will remind me to do certain things every so often. Basically a bastardized version of my Drink Python script, but it can take multiple inputs and times.

# How does it work?
Good question. I'm not completely sure myself. This entire thing would not exist without Google, various StackExchange forums, and the countless amazing people who blog about the features of Python, what they do, and how to use them.

# How do I use it?
1. Enter a list of things to be reminded about, seperated by a comma and a space (Ex: Remind me to: eat, sleep, drink water, etc.)

2. Enter how long until you're reminded to do them. (Ex: How many minutes until I remind you? 5 (minutes until the reminder))

# Note: The program will ask you for time based on your last request and work backwards. For example, my requests could be "eat, sleep, drink some water" and it would ask me when I want to drink water, sleep, and eat, in that order.

3. Wait to be reminded via a pop-up window

# To-Do:
1. Fix counter so that it counts based on individual requests
2. Get reminder function to run forever rather than just the number of times in num_task
